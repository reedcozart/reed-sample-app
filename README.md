# Create and deploy a basic Java Spring application

> We have similar applications available for [Go](https://github.com/IBM/go-web-app), [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-web-app), [Python Flask](https://github.com/IBM/flask-web-app), [Swift](https://github.com/IBM/swift-web-app), and [Node](https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-web-app).

In this sample application, you will create a basic Java web application using Spring. This provides a good starting point for creating Java microservice applications running on [Spring](https://spring.io/). It contains no default application code, but comes with standard best practices, including a health check.

Capabilities are provided through dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. The ports are set to the defaults of `8080` for http and `8443` for https in the `pom.xml` file.

The application exposes the following endpoints:
* Health endpoint: `<host>:<port>/health` e.g. http://localhost:8080/health
* Web content: `<host>:<port>`

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/create-app?starterKit=402006ad-52b5-3cba-9029-c7d77ac2209a) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first. Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

</p>

Use the button above to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud. This option will create a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted Git lab project and DevOps toolchain. You will have the option of deploying to either Cloud Foundry or a Kubernetes cluster. [IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud. 


### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native Application Development

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/),
    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)
    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)
    
To build and run an application:
1. `mvn install`
1. `java -jar ./target/springwebapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

To run an application in Docker use the Docker file called `Dockerfile`. If you do not want to install Maven locally you can use `Dockerfile-tools` to build a container with Maven installed.

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Create an application on IBM Cloud by running:

```bash
ibmcloud dev create
```

This will create and download a starter application with the necessary files needed for local development and deployment.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, run one of the following commands:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t buildpack // to Cloud Foundry
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container // to K8s cluster
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```

## Next Steps
* Learn more about augmenting your Java applications on IBM Cloud with the [Java Programming Guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/java?topic=java-getting-started).
* Explore other [sample applications](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits) on IBM Cloud.
